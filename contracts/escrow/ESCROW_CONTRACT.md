# Soroban Escrow Smart Contract

## Overview

The Escrow Smart Contract is a Soroban WASM contract that manages the automatic settlement of deals based on shipping milestones. It removes platform escrow custody risk by enforcing milestone verification and automatic fund distribution through smart contract execution.

## Issue

- **Issue #345**: Design Soroban smart contract for automatic escrow settlement
- **Issue #1089**: Replay and reentrancy idempotency guarantees

The contract enables automatic, trustless payout execution when milestones are verified, eliminating the need for platform-managed escrow accounts.

## Contract State

The contract maintains the following state data:

### Core Deal Information
- **Admin**: Account authorized to approve milestones and settle funds
- **Farmer**: Recipient of 98% of escrow funds
- **Platform**: Recipient of 2% fee from escrow funds
- **USDC Token**: ERC-20 compatible token contract address
- **Deal Value**: Total deal amount in USDC stroops
- **Funding Deadline**: Unix timestamp for funding deadline

### Investor Information
- **Investors**: Map of investor wallet addresses to their cumulative contributions
- **Total Funded**: Cumulative USDC received from investors
- **Refunded**: Map indicating which contributors have already claimed a refund

### Milestone Tracking
- **Milestones Count**: Total number of milestones required for completion
- **Milestones Completed**: Number of successfully recorded milestones
- **Milestone Data**: Map storing completion status and timestamp for each milestone

### Release State
- **Released**: Boolean flag indicating if funds have been distributed
- **Delivery Approved**: Legacy flag for delivery approval (deprecated in favor of milestone system)
- **OperationInProgress**: Guard set while a contract operation invokes a token transfer

## Idempotency and Replay Guarantees

The contract uses separate guards for initialization, refund eligibility, claims, and external transfers:

- **Initialization:** `initialize` checks for the existing `Admin` key and returns `AlreadyInitialized` on every subsequent call without overwriting the original configuration.
- **Funding:** `fund` is the existing add-shareholder/funding operation and the only funding entrypoint. Each successful positive call transfers the amount and adds it to both `TotalFunded` and the caller's contribution. Repeated positive calls are additive rather than replay no-ops; they do not overwrite the original contribution. Funding after `Released` returns `AlreadyReleased`, and a previously refunded caller has its refund marker cleared by a new successful contribution.
- **Timestamp and investor checks:** `refund_after_expiry` and `refund_all_after_expiry` require `now > funding_deadline`, reject a released or target-met deal, and inspect the caller's positive contribution before claiming it. `fund` does not enforce the funding deadline or target, so it can be used after the deadline and can exceed the deal value in this version.
- **Single-claim state:** `record_milestone` rejects an already recorded milestone ID. `release` and `settle_escrow` set `Released` before their token transfers, so a replay returns `AlreadyReleased` without paying either recipient again. `Refunded` provides the corresponding per-contributor single-refund check.
- **Operation lock and reentrancy:** `OperationInProgress` is set around token transfers. Reentrant state-changing calls return `OperationInProgress`; active reentrant refund calls return success without transferring funds.
- **Close and funding lifecycle:** This version has no `set_funding_closed`, `close`, `add_shareholder`, `EscoFunded`, or `Cancelled` entrypoint or state. `Released` is a boolean set by `release` and `settle_escrow`, not a named lifecycle enum. `refund_all_after_expiry` is a batch-refund operation, not a close operation. Repeated batch refunds are successful no-ops when no pending claims remain; there is no repeated `close` call to document.

## Data Structures

### Milestone Struct
```rust
pub struct Milestone {
    pub id: u32,              // Unique milestone identifier (0-indexed)
    pub completed: bool,      // Completion status
    pub timestamp: u64,       // Block timestamp when recorded
}
```

### DataKey Enum
Defines all storage keys for contract state:
```rust
pub enum DataKey {
    Admin,                    // Primary admin account
    Farmer,                   // Farmer/beneficiary address
    Platform,                 // Platform fee account
    UsdcToken,               // USDC token contract
    DealValue,               // Total deal value in stroops
    TotalFunded,             // Cumulative funding received
    Released,                // Settlement completed flag
    DeliveryApproved,        // Legacy delivery flag
    MilestonesCount,         // Total milestones required
    MilestonesCompleted,     // Milestones recorded
    Investors,               // Map of investor addresses to their investment amounts
    MilestoneData,           // Map of milestone records
    FundingDeadline,         // Unix timestamp for funding deadline
    Refunded,                // Map of investor addresses to their refund status
    FrozenContributors,      // Map of frozen contributor addresses
    OperationInProgress,
}
```

## Public Methods

### Initialization

```rust
pub fn initialize(
    env: Env,
    admin: Address,
    farmer: Address,
    platform: Address,
    usdc_token: Address,

---

### Milestone Recording

```rust
pub fn record_milestone(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    milestone_id: u32,
) -> Result<(), Error>
```

Records completion of a shipping milestone. Only authorized accounts (admin or farmer) can record milestones.

**Parameters:**
- `caller` - Account recording the milestone (must be admin or farmer)
- `milestone_id` - Milestone ID (0-indexed, must be < milestone_count)

**Authorization:**
- Only admin or farmer can record milestones (Unauthorized error)
- Caller must provide valid signature (require_auth check)

**Validation:**
- Milestone ID must be valid (InvalidMilestones error)
- Milestone cannot already be recorded (MilestoneAlreadyRecorded error)

**Behavior:**
- Records milestone with current block timestamp
- Increments milestones_completed counter
- Does NOT automatically settle funds (must call settle_escrow separately)

**Events:**
- `milestone`: Emits milestone_id

---

### Escrow Settlement

```rust
pub fn settle_escrow(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
) -> Result<(), Error>
```

Settles the escrow by distributing funds to farmer and platform. Can only be called when all milestones are completed and funds are available.

**Authorization:**
- Only admin can settle (Unauthorized error)
- Caller must provide valid signature (require_auth check)

**Prerequisites:**
- All milestones must be recorded (InsufficientMilestonesCompleted error)
- Total funded must be >= deal value (BalanceInsufficient error)
- Funds must not already be released (AlreadyReleased error)
- No transfer operation may be active (OperationInProgress error)

**Fund Distribution:**
- Farmer: 98% of total funded amount
- Platform: 2% of total funded amount
- Uses USDC token contract transfer calls

**Events:**
- `settled`: Emits total_funded amount

---

### Fund Deposition

```rust
pub fn fund(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    amount: i128,
) -> Result<(), Error>
```

Allows investors to deposit USDC into the escrow contract.

**Parameters:**
- `caller` - Investor account funding the escrow
- `amount` - USDC amount to deposit in stroops

**Validation:**
- Amount must be positive (InvalidAmount error)
- Contract must be initialized (NotInitialized error)
- Funds must not be released (AlreadyReleased error)
- No other transfer operation may be active (OperationInProgress error)

**Behavior:**
- Transfers USDC from caller to contract
- Increments total_funded balance
- Repeated funding for the same contributor is additive
- Does NOT check if deal is fully funded (can fund beyond deal_value)

**Events:**
- `funded`: Emits amount deposited

---

### Legacy Methods (Backward Compatibility)

```rust
pub fn approve_delivery(env: Env, caller: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

Legacy method for approval workflow. Deprecated in favor of milestone system.

```rust
pub fn submit_delivery_milestone(env: Env, caller: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

Legacy milestone submission. Deprecated in favor of record_milestone.

```rust
pub fn release(env: Env, caller: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

Legacy fund release. Deprecated in favor of settle_escrow. It shares the same `Released` guard and transfer-operation guard as settlement, so replay calls cannot pay twice.

---

## Refund Functions

### Individual Refund After Expiry

```rust
pub fn refund_after_expiry(env: Env, contributor: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

Allows a contributor to request a refund after the funding deadline has passed and the target has not been met. This function is idempotent - calling it multiple times for the same contributor will succeed after the first successful refund.

**Parameters:**
- `contributor` - The address of the contributor requesting a refund

**Validation:**
- Deadline must have passed (DeadlineNotPassed error)
- Funds must not have been released (AlreadyReleased error), checked before the target
- Target must not be met (TargetMet error)
- Contributor must have funds to refund (NothingToRefund error)

**Behavior:**
- Marks contributor as refunded to prevent double refunds
- Sets the contributor's recorded contribution to zero before transfer
- Updates total funded amount before transfer
- Returns success if already refunded, including when the contribution is now zero
- Active reentrant refund calls are no-ops

**Events:**
- `refund`: Emits (contributor_address, refund_amount)

---

### Batch Refund After Expiry

```rust
pub fn refund_all_after_expiry(env: Env, caller: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

Allows the admin to batch refund all contributors after the funding deadline has passed and the target has not been met. This is an optional convenience function for processing multiple refunds at once.

**Parameters:**
- `caller` - The admin account calling this function

**Authorization:**
- Only admin can call (Unauthorized error)

**Validation:**
- Deadline must have passed (DeadlineNotPassed error)
- Funds must not have been released (AlreadyReleased error), checked before the target
- Target must not be met (TargetMet error)

**Behavior:**
- Refunds all contributors who haven't been refunded yet
- Skips contributors who have already been refunded
- Persists each contributor's refunded state and reduced total before transfer
- Updates total funded amount
- Returns success without duplicate transfers when no contributors remain pending
- Efficiently processes multiple refunds in one transaction

**Events:**
- `refund`: Emits (contributor_address, refund_amount) for each refund
- `batch_refund`: Emits total_refunded_amount

## Compliance Features

### Contributor Freezing

The escrow contract includes compliance features to prevent payouts to frozen addresses, ensuring regulatory compliance and risk management.

```rust
pub fn freeze_contributor(env: Env, caller: Address, contributor: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

Freezes a contributor to prevent them from receiving refunds or settlements. Only the admin can freeze contributors.

**Parameters:**
- `caller` - The admin account calling this function
- `contributor` - The address to freeze

**Authorization:**
- Only admin can freeze (Unauthorized error)

**Events:**
- `frozen`: Emits the frozen contributor address

---

```rust
pub fn unfreeze_contributor(env: Env, caller: Address, contributor: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

Unfreezes a contributor to allow them to receive refunds or settlements. Only the admin can unfreeze contributors.

**Parameters:**
- `caller` - The admin account calling this function
- `contributor` - The address to unfreeze

**Authorization:**
- Only admin can unfreeze (Unauthorized error)
- Contributor must be frozen (NotFrozen error)

**Events:**
- `unfrozen`: Emits the unfrozen contributor address

---

```rust
pub fn is_contributor_frozen(env: Env, contributor: Address) -> bool
```

Returns whether a contributor is currently frozen.

---

### Compliance Halt Events

When a payout is refused due to a frozen address, the contract emits a `compliance_halt` event that can be indexed and surfaced in UI/notifications.

**Event Emission:**
- `compliance_halt`: Emits the address that was blocked from receiving funds

**Paths that check frozen status:**
- `refund_after_expiry()` - Blocks refunds to frozen contributors
- `refund_all_after_expiry()` - Skips frozen contributors in batch refunds
- `settle_escrow()` - Blocks settlement if farmer or platform is frozen
- `release()` - Blocks legacy release if farmer or platform is frozen

---

## Usage Flow

### 1. Initialize Contract

```rust
EscrowContract::initialize(
    env,
    admin_address,
    farmer_address,
    platform_address,
    usdc_token_address,
    10_000_000_000,  // 1000 USDC (7 decimal places)
    3,               // 3 milestones required
    vec![investor1, investor2, investor3],
    1234567890,      // Funding deadline (Unix timestamp)
)
```

### 2. Investors Fund the Deal

```rust
// Each investor deposits funds
EscrowContract::fund(env, investor1, 3_000_000_000);  // 300 USDC
EscrowContract::fund(env, investor2, 3_000_000_000);  // 300 USDC
EscrowContract::fund(env, investor3, 4_000_000_000);  // 400 USDC
// Total: 1000 USDC
```

### 3. Record Milestones as They Complete

```rust
// Shipping milestone 0 completed
EscrowContract::record_milestone(env, admin, 0);

// Shipping milestone 1 completed
EscrowContract::record_milestone(env, farmer, 1);

// Shipping milestone 2 completed
EscrowContract::record_milestone(env, admin, 2);
```

### 4. Settle the Escrow

```rust
// Once all milestones recorded and funds available
EscrowContract::settle_escrow(env, admin);
// Transfers 980 USDC to farmer, 20 USDC to platform
```

### 5. Handle Failed Funding (Refund Flow)

If the funding deadline passes without meeting the target:

```rust
// Check if deadline has passed
let deadline = EscrowContract::get_funding_deadline(env);
let now = env.ledger().timestamp();

if now > deadline && !EscrowContract::target_met(env) {
    // Individual contributor refund
    EscrowContract::refund_after_expiry(env, contributor_address);

    // Or batch refund all contributors (admin only)
    EscrowContract::refund_all_after_expiry(env, admin_address);
}
```

### 6. Compliance Management (Freeze/Unfreeze)

For regulatory compliance and risk management:

```rust
// Freeze a contributor (admin only)
EscrowContract::freeze_contributor(env, admin_address, suspicious_address);

// Check if contributor is frozen
let is_frozen = EscrowContract::is_contributor_frozen(env, suspicious_address);

// Unfreeze a contributor (admin only)
EscrowContract::unfreeze_contributor(env, admin_address, cleared_address);
```

## Security Considerations

### Authorization
- Only admin can settle escrow funds
- Only admin or farmer can record milestones
- All operations require valid digital signatures
- Unauthorized accounts receive explicit error messages

### Milestone Integrity
- Milestones can only be recorded once (prevents double-counting)
- Milestone IDs are validated against milestone_count
- Completion state is immutable once recorded

### Fund Safety
- Funds transferred using standard USDC token contract
- Distribution percentages (98/2) are hardcoded and cannot be changed
- Double-settlement is prevented (AlreadyReleased error)
- Funding after settlement is rejected (AlreadyReleased error)
- Reentrant token calls cannot mutate escrow state while `OperationInProgress` is set

### Validation
- Deal value must be positive
- Milestone count must be positive
- Investor list must be non-empty
- Funding amounts must be positive
